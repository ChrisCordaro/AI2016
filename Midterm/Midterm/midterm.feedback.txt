Chris,

Here is your feedback and grade breakdown by problems:

1) The experiments seem ok, except that you may not have given the perceptron
enough time to make progress after the linear regression starting point. What
if 30 wasn't enough? -2pts
Did you only run the experiment once? Or the result is the average of multiple
trials? - 1pt
You have some really strange things, such as, transposing linear regression?
That is incorrect. -5pts

2) Why is your code not commented? -2pts

3) Good picture/drawing. +5pts


Peace,
